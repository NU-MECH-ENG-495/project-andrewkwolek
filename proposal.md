## Project Proposal
I am looking to do a project that is associated with my winter project, but I think it is a bit out of scope for what I am trying to do. I am working with a library called BlueOS that interfaces with an underwater ROV and it is used as a layer between a user computer and low level firmware used to control the robot. The code base is compatible with ROS2, however I donâ€™t believe there is an actual implementation with ROS2. I think it would be a good exercise to try and implement at least some level of BlueOS in ROS2. I have not done any ROS2 development in C++ and I think it would be great practice to try and do that.
I think the first step will be to map out the architecture. I have never made a ROS2 library before so establishing what needs to be implemented and how to define everything will be a good first step. I am familiar enough with the hardware that I should have a decent idea of how to run everything. I know ROS2 is compatible with Raspberry Pi which is the onboard computer used with my robot. I think learning how to interface with the hardware and the firmware will be the first step to developing the package.
